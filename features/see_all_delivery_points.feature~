Feature: see all Delivery Points

	As an admin
	So that I can know every location where Customers can pick up food
	I want to see a list of all DeliveryPoints


Scenario: delete a delivery point
	Given the following Delivery Points exist:
		| address| latitude| longitude| id|
		| 2650 Durant Ave | 15.7 | 45.6 | 1|
       And I am on the Listing delivery_points page   
       When I follow "Destroy"
       Then I should see "Are you sure?"
       And I press "yes"
       Then I should see "Delivery point successfully deleted"
       And I should not see "2650 Durant Ave 15.7 45.6"
